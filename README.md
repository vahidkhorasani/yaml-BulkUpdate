# yaml-BulkUpdate

This script can be used to update multiple YAML files with different environment variables .
It also checks the yaml files syntax. 

After cloning the repository just run the script. It will create an empty directory named 'Yaml-BulkUpdate' in your HOME directory. Then it needs the yamllint config file to be copied into it. Just rename the yamllint file to '~/Yaml-BulkUpdate/.yamllint' .

I have used some variables based on my need. It's obvious that you may need to change different variables in your YAML file so make sure to define yours in the script.
