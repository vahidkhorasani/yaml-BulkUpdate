# yaml-BulkUpdate
This script can be used to update multiple YAML files with different environment variables .
It also checks the yaml files syntax. 
You can use my 'yamllint' file in repository by copying it to 'Yaml-BulkUpdate' directory which will be created when you run the script for the first time.
You can also use your custom yamllint config file or even the default one.
Just make sure you have renamed the yamllint config file to '~/Yaml-BulkUpdate/.yamllint' because the syntax checker function will search for that.

I have used some variables based on my need. It's obvious that you may need to change different variables in your YAML file so make sure to define yours in the script.

I will work on this script to make it more useable as soon as I have enough free time but for now just use it by making some custom changes.
